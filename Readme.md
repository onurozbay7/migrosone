#### ðŸ“Œ Extensibility Note:
```
This application currently uses PostgreSQL and in-memory storage to keep things simple and fast.
Since it's a monolithic and lightweight system, i intentionally avoided overengineering.
However, in a production environment, store entry logging can be decoupled using an event-driven architecture such as Apache Kafka to improve scalability and fault tolerance.
Additionally, courier state can be externalized to Redis to ensure persistence across restarts and enable real-time access in a distributed setup.
